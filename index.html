The story of the “Wealthy Greedy Man” centres around Akindaju who has a lot of possessions and never satisfied but eager to acquire more; irrespective of what it will cost him including lives and properties to the detriment of others.
Akindaju is a man surrounded by both good and bad friends as it is the case in the contemporary world but because he always wants the pendulum to swing to his favour therefore only listen to the advise of bad friends who have the same mind to do evil.
There is always a law of harvest.  If a farmer goes to farm and plants, he will surely wait to reap the reward.  The same is applicable in the literary world. It is a law that must surely be fulfilled. There is nothing anybody can do about it. Those who sow evil will reap evil while those who sow righteousness will reap same.</p>

The story of the “Wealthy Greedy Man” centres around Akindaju who has a lot of possessions and never satisfied but eager to acquire more; irrespective of what it will cost him including lives and properties to the detriment of others.
Akindaju is a man surrounded by both good and bad friends as it is the case in the contemporary world but because he always wants the pendulum to swing to his favour therefore only listen to the advise of bad friends who have the same mind to do evil.
There is always a law of harvest.  If a farmer goes to farm and plants, he will surely wait to reap the reward.  The same is applicable in the literary world. It is a law that must surely be fulfilled. There is nothing anybody can do about it. Those who sow evil will reap evil while those who sow righteousness will reap same.</p>

                <p>In this drama, we see Akindaju using his wealth to dispossess innocent and helpless citizens of their properties and belongings in the community.  In collaboration with his evil friends, he plans to make provisions for social amenities like pipe borne water, electricity and good roads available at cut throat prices but never lived to enjoy the facilities. What happened in this book is a lesson to all.
After a long time, with opportunities to change his way of life which he refused, nemesis caught up with him and ends up loosing his life with all who supported him including his wife while the advocates of peace and good works were rewarded. The book has lots of morals to teach both the young and old.
The book “The Wealthy Greedy Man” exposes some of the behavior of highly placed people in the society, which to a large extent, not desirable and acceptable. In any society, you find a mix of upright and bad eggs which is equally depicted in the society called Miofejo.</p>
